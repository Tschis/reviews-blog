[Wikipedia summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)):

God of War (2018) is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive 
Entertainment.

The game is the eighth installment in the God of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's 
God of War III. Unlike previous games, which were loosely based on Greek mythology, this installment is loosely
inspired by Norse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient Scandinavia in the realm of Midgard.

For the first time in the series, there are two protagonists: Kratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only
playable character, and his young son, Atreus. Following the death of Kratos' second wife, Faye (Atreus' mother), the
two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms.

## Review

### Setup
> - **Version:** PlayStation 5  
> - **Difficulty:** Give Me a Balanced Experience  
> - **Total playing time:** 36 hours (based on PS5 save stats)

### Comments

> **Note**  
> - I had not played previous entries in the series.  
> - I only had a vague idea of some important points in the story.

This was the first title I played on my PlayStation 5. I got my console bundled with the God of War Ragnar√∂k, so I 
wanted to play the prequel before diving into the recent installment.

Although I did not play on hard difficulties, I have to say it felt like the game was not exactly challenging. Apart
from the Valkyries, which are optional, it didn't give me a hard time. A quick lookup online, didn't seem like the game
was significantly changed by increasing difficulty, probably just adding more damage and/or defense or health to 
enemies, which is not particularly interesting for me.

### Pros

* Fighting the Valkyries was a welcome challenge
  * Most of them had interesting mechanics and took me some effort until I got it right 
  * Sigrun was amazing. I died a lot, but clearly it was due to me needing to *git gud*
* The supporting characters were fantastic. More specifically, Mimir, Sindri & Brok, and the Witch, were exceptional
  * Mimir was very entertaining, and presented me with a wide range of emotions
  * Sindri & Brok, specially Sindri, had me laughing out loud in most interactions
  * Witch was caring and strong, sometimes distant but mostly impactful in each interaction 
* Since I had no background knowledge on the series or the pantheon, I felt like I was learning together with Atreus

### Cons

* Pacing was a bit strange. For example, it seemed to me that the game just ended out of nowhere
* Did not feel like the big bosses were actually the big bosses
  * None of the fights were challenging
  * Cinematics within the fights were cool, but in the end it just felt cheap as the rest wasn't hard
  * Baldur final fight was so easy that I didn't realize it was the final battle
* I had way more pommels / talismans / enchantments than I knew what to do with
